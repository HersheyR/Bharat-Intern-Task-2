Task 2- Cat and Dog Image Classifier : Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python.
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats. 
Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm has been used to build the model.
The procedure is as follows:
  1) Data Cleaning
  2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  3) Data Pre-Processing
  4) Model Building
  5) Improving the Model
